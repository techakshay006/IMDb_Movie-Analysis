# IMDb_Movie-Analysis

### Q.Had you think about how Directors , Producers , Production house so on.. think about how to choose Actor, Budget, Genre etc. 

A. I don't think anyone from viewers think about this because we don't even care about it. 

But, here our reviews, ratings, TRP and etc matters a lot to them to decide what should be done at what time

 So, Basically I am ging to tell you guys how they predict their result for upcoming projects.

In accordance with Data sets :
      - Movie+Assignment+Data 
    
(Contains top 100 rated movies over the past decade along with various piece of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online.)

Task which I have performed here are:

  - Firstly, you have to read the data
  - Analysis of data (find irregularities and if required fix them)
  - Then I talked about the profit and analysis over it using graphical representation
  - Then I talked about losses.
 
   --Interesting part I have discussed about the "MetaCritic" which is a website that aggregates reviews of films, TV shows, and many more from which I have only done analysis
 on films reviews.
 
 In the dataset there is a Column MetaCritic and IMDb_rating and done some analysis on these two columns which individually says different story regarding reviews or ratings
 
   --Now, here comes most popular actor or trios which could be benefit for the film maker to take right descion.
 this basically give analysis on the basis of facebook ratings which was given by their fans.
 
   --Now, there is analysis of Runtime of movie, means in the past decades what max or min runtime movies were made using graphical representation
   --I concured the Demographic analysis to predict which type of genere public like the most and used some graphical representation techniques.
   --Then, I have done analysis on the basis of #Gender which plays important role in making the movie
 used some graphical representation here too
 
 ---Last but off course not the least I have done prediction or analysis on the country (non-USA vs USA)
 
  It comes to end but you again guys can intefere some more interesting insights on this data sets. 
 
 # Thank you!
